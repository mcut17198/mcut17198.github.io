        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
        <p>Hello, it's Carter.</p>
        <p>To respond to the Free Software Movement launched by the Free Software Foundation and struggle to reach the goal of getting my computers and other devices running 100% free software, I will be deregistering most of my proprietary social/IM services. The schedule is shown below.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>SnapChat: February 12, 2023</li>
        <li>WhatsApp: February 12, 2023</li>
        <li>Facebook: July 20, 2023</li>
        <li>Discord: July 25, 2023</li>
        <li>Instagram: July 27, 2023</li>
        <li>Twitter: July 28, 2023</li>
        <li>Skype: July 30, 2023 (Just delete all contacts and sign out, the Microsoft Account won't be closed)</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams: July 30, 2023 (Just delete all contacts and sign out, the Microsoft Account won't be closed)</li>
        <li>WeChat (lovely17198): July 7, 2024 (begin preparation) July 19, 2024 (apply for deregistration)</li>
        <li>WeChat (lovely17199): July 20, 2024 (begin preparation) July 22, 2024 (apply for deregistration)</li>
        <li>ICQ New: July 27, 2024</li>
        <li>Telegram: January 26, 2025</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the deregistration of these services, I will be using Matrix.org, which is secure, open source and free as in speech, mainly as my IM solution.</p>
        <p>My account is: @mcut17198:comm.cx</p>
        <p>If you want to register Matrix.org service, just install a Matrix.org client and follow the instructions to register. The process is simple. Element or FluffyChat are recommended for your mobile devices and NeoChat is recommended for PCs or laptops. I recommended the server comm.cx for those who lives in China and matrix.org for those who lives outside China.</p>
        <p>Sorry for the inconvenience. However, software freedom is essential for computer users including me and is worth fighting for. Therefore, I have made the decision to deregister these proprietary social/IM services, in order to get rid of proprietary software.</p>
        <p>In future, I will devote myself in the Free Software Movement.</p>
        <p>Best wishes!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Yours,</p>
        <p>Carter Zhang</p>
